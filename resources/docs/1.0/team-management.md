## Concept

Team Management in Search Tweak empowers users to efficiently create and oversee teams. Users can form teams and invite others, assigning them specific roles. There are two roles available: `Administrator` and `Search Evaluator`. Administrators have complete access to all features, while Search Evaluators are limited to evaluating search results. Administrators can also change user roles and remove users from the team if necessary.

All resources, including search endpoints, models, and evaluations, are created within the team context, ensuring they are accessible and manageable by the team.
