This scale provides a more granular rating system, allowing you to assign a grade from **1** (lowest relevance) to **10** (highest relevance). It helps capture subtle distinctions in how well a result matches the user’s intent.

# Scoring Guidelines
- **1–2 (Very Poor)**
  - The result is almost entirely irrelevant or misleading.
  - *Example*: Searching for "smartphone" and getting a lamp listing.

- **3–4 (Poor)**
  - The result has limited connection to the search term and does not meet the intent.
  - *Example*: Searching for "running shoes" and getting generic footwear accessories (e.g., laces).

- **5–6 (Fair)**
  - The result is somewhat related to the search term but isn’t a strong match for the intent.
  - *Example*: Searching for "laptop bag" and getting a small travel pouch that could fit only a tablet.

- **7–8 (Good)**
  - The result aligns well with the search term and intent, but may lack some specifics.
  - *Example*: Searching for "gaming laptop" and getting a powerful laptop that matches many gaming requirements, yet missing certain specs (e.g., insufficient RAM).

- **9–10 (Perfect)**
  - The result is highly relevant and precisely meets the search term and intent.
  - *Example*: Searching for "4K monitor" and getting a 4K monitor with exactly the advertised features and specs.
