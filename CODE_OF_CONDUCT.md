# Code of Conduct

## Purpose

We are committed to providing a welcoming, respectful, and inclusive environment for everyone involved in this project. This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for participants to foster a positive community experience and avoid unacceptable behavior.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all participants in the project, including contributors, maintainers, and those interacting in project spaces (both online and offline). This includes, but is not limited to, issues, pull requests, discussions, forums, and project events.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contribute to creating a positive environment include:
- Being respectful and considerate to others.
- Using welcoming and inclusive language.
- Accepting constructive criticism gracefully.
- Focusing on what is best for the community.
- Showing empathy and kindness towards other participants.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:
- Harassment or discrimination of any kind, including but not limited to personal attacks, derogatory comments, and offensive jokes.
- Trolling, insulting, or derogatory comments and personal or political attacks.
- Public or private harassment.
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission.
- Any other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Enforcement

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, pull requests, or other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, or harmful.

## Reporting Violations

If you observe or are subject to unacceptable behavior, or have any concerns, please report it by emailing [andrey@searchtweak.com](mailto:andrey@searchtweak.com). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly, and will be handled confidentially to the extent possible.

## Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Participants asked to stop any inappropriate behavior are expected to comply immediately. If a participant engages in behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, the project maintainers may take any action they deem appropriate, including temporary or permanent expulsion from the project and community without warning.
